![](https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png)

Welcome to the R Bootcamp for PSU researchers. 
The goal of this two-day workshop is to provide a broad introduction to the use of the R programming language for social science research. 
Participants are **not** expected to have prior experience with R or another programming language. 
The scope and schedule of the course is provided [here](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp-2019/schedule.html).

To register, complete [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/y3DQ64zSxzG1VgdE7).

## About this course

R is one of the core languages in data science. It's free and fun to use. 
Join us in learning how to use this tool to accelerate your research.

The course *heavily* emphasizes the use of the [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) integrated development environment (IDE).
You don't have to use RStudio to use R, but we think that doing so makes R an even more powerful tool.
Plus, RStudio has fully featured free versions, including some available entirely in your web browser.

## Who's registered?

Here are some data about the registrants as of `r Sys.time()`:

```{r registrant-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
pkg_list <- c("googlesheets", "googledrive", "tidyverse", "ggplot2", "ggmosaic")
lapply(pkg_list, library, quietly = TRUE, character.only = TRUE)

# r_funcs <- list.files("R", "\\.R$", full.names = TRUE)
# lapply(r_funcs, source, echo = FALSE)
source("R/registrants.R")
update_registration_data()
rg <- readr::read_csv("data/csv/registrants.csv")
```

We have `r dim(rg)[1]` people registered so far.
The following table tells us a bit about them.
(These data are generated from the GoogleSheet you completed to register.
The are processed entirely in an R-based workflow that updates automatically everytime we regenerate this website.)

```{r registrant-table, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Make table
pos_dept <- xtabs(formula = ~ position + dept, data = rg)
knitr::kable(pos_dept)
```

### What to bring

We ask that you bring an open mind, enthusiasm, and a willingness to ask questions even if they seem trivial.
The classrooms we have chosen for the bootcamp have computers with Windows 10, so you do *not* need to bring your own computer.
We will use a standard computing environment set up for your use that takes advantage of the RStudio Server program.
This means that RStudio will run in your web browser.

You *will* need to make sure that you can log on to the PSU system using your Penn State Access ID (e.g., `rog1`).

### Laptop users

If you want to bring your own laptop, please be advised that we will have limited ability to support the installation and use of R on your personal machines.
You will want to take the steps outlined [here](before-the-bootcamp.html) to ensure that your computer can connect to the Penn State wifi.
If you want to run RStudio in a web browser, then follow [these](rstudio-tlt.html) instructions.
Or (or in addition) you may want to install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

### Course materials

Here is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/psu-psychology/r-bootcamp-2019/) where the course files are shared.

To download all course materials, you can clone the entire Github repository using the command ```git clone https://github.com/psu-psychology/r-bootcamp-2019.git```.
You can also use Github Desktop to clone the repository using a more user-friendly interface: <https://desktop.github.com>
If Git is unfamiliar to you, you can obtain a zip archive of the current version of all files here: <https://github.com/psu-psychology/r-bootcamp-2019/archive/master.zip>
