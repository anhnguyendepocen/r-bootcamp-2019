Welcome to the R Bootcamp for PSU researchers. 
The goal of this two-day workshop is to provide a broad introduction to the use of the R programming language for social science research. 
Participants are **not** expected to have prior experience with R or another programming language. 
The scope and schedule of the course is provided [here](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp-2019/schedule.html).

**Bootcamp registration is now closed. See you there!**

## About this course

R is one of the core languages in data science. It's free and fun to use. 
Join us in learning how to use this tool to accelerate your research.

The course *heavily* emphasizes the use of the [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) integrated development environment (IDE).
You don't have to use RStudio to use R, but we think that doing so makes R an even more powerful tool.
Plus, RStudio has fully featured free versions, including some available entirely in your web browser.

## Who's registered?

Here are some data about the registrants as of `r Sys.time()`:

```{r registrant-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# update_registration_data()
rg <- readr::read_csv("data/csv/registrants.csv")
```

We have `r dim(rg)[1]` people registered so far.
The following table tells us a bit about them.
(These data are generated from the GoogleSheet you completed to register.
The data are processed entirely in an R-based workflow that updates automatically every time we regenerate this website.)

```{r registrant-table, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Make table
pos_dept <- xtabs(formula = ~ position + dept, data = rg)
knitr::kable(pos_dept)
```

### What to bring

We ask that you bring an open mind, enthusiasm, and a willingness to ask questions even if they seem trivial.
The classrooms we have chosen for the bootcamp have computers with Windows 10, so you do *not* need to bring your own computer.
We will use a standard computing environment set up for your use that takes advantage of the RStudio Server program.
This means that RStudio will run in your web browser.

You *will* need to make sure that you can log on to the PSU system using your Penn State Access ID (e.g., `rog1`).

### Laptop users

If you want to bring your own laptop, please be advised that we will have limited ability to support the installation and use of R on your personal machines.
You will want to take the steps outlined [here](before-the-bootcamp.html) to ensure that your computer can connect to the Penn State wifi.
If you want to run RStudio in a web browser, then follow [these](rstudio-tlt.html) instructions.
Or (or in addition) you may want to install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

### Course materials

Here is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/psu-psychology/r-bootcamp-2019/) where the course files are shared.

We recommend creating a new project inside Rstudio to link with the Github site. This will allow you to 'pull' the latest changes to the repository, ensuring that you have the most current materials. Please follow the [instructions here](before-the-bootcamp.html#obtain-the-materials-for-bootcamp).
