Welcome to the R Bootcamp for PSU researchers. 
The goal of this two-day workshop is to provide a broad introduction to the use of the R programming language for social science research. 
Participants are **not** expected to have prior experience with R or another programming language. 
The scope and schedule of the course is provided [here](https://psu-psychology.github.io/r-bootcamp-2019/schedule.html).

## About this course

R is one of the core languages in data science. It's free and fun to use. 
Join us in learning how to use this tool to accelerate your research.

The course *heavily* emphasizes the use of the [RStudio](http://rstudio.com) integrated development environment (IDE).
You don't have to use RStudio to use R, but we think that doing so makes R an even more powerful tool.
Plus, RStudio has fully featured free versions, including some available entirely in your web browser.

### What to bring

We ask that you bring an open mind, enthusiasm, and a willingness to ask questions even if they seem trivial.
The classrooms we have chosen for the bootcamp have computers with Windows 10, so you do *not* need to bring your own computer.
We will use a standard computing environment set up for your use that takes advantage of the RStudio Server program.
This means that RStudio will run in your web browser.

You *will* need to make sure that you can log on to the PSU system using your Penn State Access ID (e.g., rog1).

### Laptop users

If you want to bring your own laptop, please be advised that we will have limited ability to support the installation and use of R on your personal machines.
You will want to take the steps outlined [here](before-the-bootcamp.html) to ensure that your computer can connect to the Penn State wifi.
If you want to run RStudio in a web browser, then follow [these](rstudio-tlt.html) instructions.
Or (or in addition) you may want to install [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

### Course materials

Here is the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/psu-psychology/r-bootcamp-2019/) where the course files are shared.

To download all course materials, you can clone the entire Github repository using the command ```git clone https://github.com/psu-psychology/r-bootcamp-2019.git```.
You can also use Github Desktop to clone the repository using a more user-friendly interface: <https://desktop.github.com>
If Git is unfamiliar to you, you can obtain a zip archive of the current version of all files here: <https://github.com/psu-psychology/r-bootcamp-2019/archive/master.zip>
