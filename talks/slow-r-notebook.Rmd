# Background

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# Vectors

Vectors or "atomic" vectors in R are one dimensional groups of things that have the same class.

## Make a vector of numbers

```{r make-numeric-vect}
# Modify this code so that it produces a vector of numbers.
# To check your work, run this chunk by pressing the right arrow button
my_nums <- 

if (is.numeric(my_nums)) {
  message("Righto!")
} else {
  message("Sorry, try again.")
}
```

Use the colon (`:`) operator to make a vector of numbers between 1 and 23.

```{r}
# Modify the code as suggested
chromosome_index <- 
  
if (is.numeric(chromosome_index)) {
  message("Them's numbers, alright")
} else {
  message("Show me the numbers!")
}

if (length(chromosome_index == 23)) {
  message("Right length!")
  }
if (max(chromosome_index == 23)) {
  message("Maximum is 23!")
}
if (min(chromosome_index) == 1) {
  message("Minimum is 1!")
}
```

## Make a vector of character strings

```{r make-character-vect}
# Modify this code so that it produces a vector of your initials
my_initials <- 
  
if (is.character(my_initials)) {
  message("Outstanding initials!")
} else {
  message("Better luck next time.")
}

# Test to see if elements are single characters.
# Uses `lapply()` command that applies a function, here `length()`
# to each element in `my_initials`
message("Are these single letters?")
(single_letters <- unlist(lapply(my_initials, length)) == 1)
```

Let's move beyond vectors of single letters.

```{r make-bigger-character-vect}
# Modify this code so that it produces a vector of first names

some_first_names <-
  
if (is.character(some_first_names)) {
  message("Great people!")
} else {
  message("Sorry, Charlie.")
}
```

## Make repeating things and sequences

Use the `seq()` command to make a sequence of even numbers from 2 to 18.

```{r seq}
# Modify the code to make the desired sequence
my_evens <- seq(from =, to =, by =)

# I like to test conditions this way. Makes it easy to see what's up.
(nine_numbers <- length(my_evens) == 9)
(min_is_2 <- min(my_evens) == 2)
(max_is_18 <- max(my_evens) == 18)

if (nine_numbers & min_is_2 & max_is_18) {
  message("You're a star student!")
} else {
  message("Keep trying!")
}
```
